### Hi there 👋

I can make a readme file to make my github profile fancy too! 😎

I'm an advocate of sharing knowledge! 👩🏻‍🏫

So if you want to be like me...

Create a new repo with your github username. 😏

In my case, it was `alexiamcdonald` and then add a README.md file. 🤯

Github secret revealed! 🪄

Now you can be a magical code monkey like me. 🙈
Good luck! 🎉

<!--
**alexiamcdonald/alexiamcdonald** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
